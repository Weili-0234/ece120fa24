Currently it includes some [survival guides](https://github.com/Weili-0234/ece120fa24/blob/main/README.md#how-to-survive-and-thrive-in-this-course) and some useful [pointers](TODO) (in some languages, references) to helpful resources regarding this course.

## How to survive and thrive in this course

For most ZJUI freshman students who had no prior experience in coding or courses taught in English, ECE 120 could be challenging. Personally, I found this course tough but interesting, as it allowed me to truly understand the computing system from buttom up and showed me some "Great Ideas in Computer Architecture" like abstraction, tradeoff, parallelism, etc.
